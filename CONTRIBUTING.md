This repo is maintained part-time. We are happy about any contributions to any part of the code.

If you want to contribute, please:
1. Open an issue first. There might be some discussion and guidance which saves everyone time in the long run.
2. If you encounter questions during implementation, ask about it in the corresponding issue.
3. When you create your PR, make sure your changes are at least somewhat covered by tests.
